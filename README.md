# File scraper (without-spooler)

### What is it used for?

* **This version of filescraper is no realy useful for anyone else then me** It save the spool file and parses the (plane) text inside, then saves it to a .xlsx file, it's set up to parse it to 1 particular format so it can't realy be changes. That said if for some reason you have a use for this go ahead, use and change it. ðŸ˜Š
